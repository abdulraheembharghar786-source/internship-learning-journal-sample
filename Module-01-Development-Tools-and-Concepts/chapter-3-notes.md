# Week 1 - Session 3: Tools in Data Science (TDS)

## 📌 Overview
This session (dated 22 Sept 2025) is part of the IIT–Madras *Tools in Data Science* series.  
It introduces foundational tools and environments that data scientists use daily, focusing on Linux basics, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and setup for modern AI/LLM workflows.

## 🖥️ Key Topics Covered
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
  - Running Linux inside Windows without a VM.
  - Importance for cross-platform workflows in data science.

- **Basic Linux Commands**
  - `ls` → List files and directories.
  - `cd` → Change directory.
  - `grep` → Search text using patterns (origin: “g/re/p” from 1973).
  - `pwd` → Show current working directory.
  - `cat` → Display file contents.

- **Environment Setup**
  - Installing and configuring tools for AI/LLM usage.
  - Connecting to Gemini and GPT models for experimentation.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understand why Linux is critical for data science workflows.
- Gain hands-on familiarity with essential shell commands.
- Learn how to set up environments for working with large language models.
- Appreciate the role of IIT–Madras in advancing AI education.

---

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- `grep` is one of the oldest and most widely used text-search tools in computing.
- WSL bridges the gap between Windows and Linux, making it easier for students to practice industry-standard workflows.
- IIT–Madras consistently ranks as India’s top engineering institute, with strong emphasis on AI and data science.

## 📚 Suggested Practice
1. Try running `ls -l` and `grep "pattern" filename.txt` in WSL.
2. Set up a Python environment in WSL and run a simple script.
3. Explore connecting to an LLM API (like Gemini or GPT) from the Linux shell.
